### Recording Audio

- **Mute Microphone**\
  Turn this on to disable microphone recording.
- **Mute System Audio**\
  Turn this on to disable system sounds from being recorded.

These options are useful when you want to record visuals only or control audio separately.

### Audio Overlays

- **Add Audio**\
  Add voice-over recordings or background music to your video.

If no audio overlays are added, your recording will only include the original microphone and system audio (unless muted).
